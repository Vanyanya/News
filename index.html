10 October 2016	by INSP News Service
Edward Smalls sells Speak Up magazine every weekday in uptown Charlotte. This put him in close proximity to the epicentre of the heated protests that exploded in the aftermath of the police shooting of Keith Lamont Scott. On the morning of 22 September, following a violent night of protest that left one dead, Edward talked with Speak Up editor Matt Shaw about the protests, gun violence, and his own story.					</div>

				<p style="font-size: 16px">BANGKOK—Thai health authorities said Friday that microcephaly in two babies was caused by the Zika virus, in what is believed to be Southeast Asia’s first confirmed case of a link between the sickness and the birth defect.
“Two of the three infants (tested) had microcephaly due to the Zika virus,” Health Ministry official Wicharn Pawan told Agence France-Presse.
The World Health Organization <abbr title="World Health Organization">(WHO)</abbr> this week said any confirmed cases in Thailand would be the first identified in Southeast Asia.
Zika causes only mild symptoms in most, including fever, sore eyes and a rash. But pregnant women with the virus risk giving birth to babies with microcephaly — a deformation that leads to abnormally small brains and heads.
				<br>
				<br>
				Thai authorities had monitored 36 pregnant women infected with the virus.
Earlier this week Thai doctors cleared two other babies with the condition of a link to Zika, a virus spread mainly by mosquitoes.
Scientists warned this month that the world should prepare for a “global epidemic” of microcephaly as the virus takes root in new countries.
Thailand expects up to 17 percent of its GDP to be generated from tourism by the end of this year and a Zika outbreak could dent visitor numbers.
On Friday the US’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel advisory urging pregnant women to “consider postponing nonessential travel to Southeast Asia countries with reports of Zika virus”.

		<p>Mother of Hampton homicide victim: ‘There’s someone who knows something’</p>
		<p>HAMPTON, Va. (WAVY) — Gwen Taylor says she talked to her son on the phone about a Thanksgiving Day road trip just 45 minutes before police say someone shot and killed him in a very public place.

Antonio “Tony” Taylor, 25, died Nov. 23, 2015 after being shot several times while sitting inside his parked car at McDonald’s on Aberdeen Road.

Victim of deadly shooting identified as Navy veteran

It’s been nearly one year of tearful days and sleepless nights for Mrs. Taylor.

“The thought that you won’t hear his voice anymore, there won’t be any hugs anymore, no ‘mama, I love you’ cards.”

Detectives with the Hampton Police Division say they are close to finding Tony’s killer, but they admit they need more information from the public before making an arrest.

“The longer it goes, the harder it becomes to solve,” said Sgt. Matt Bond. “There is some information out there that we know people have. We just need them to come forward and assist us.”

Sgt. Bond say the suspect likely fired the shot while in the car with Taylor before the shooting, but he could not confirm if the suspect was known to Taylor prior to the incident. Investigators say they found Taylor’s body lying just outside the vehicle around 6:00 that night.

Mrs. Taylor says her son graduated with honors from Hampton High School in 2008. The U.S. Navy confirms Taylor served four years active duty and received the following awards: National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and
Pistol Marksmanship Ribbon.

“He was active in church. He played the bass guitar … If he saw you coming in with your grocery bag, he would see if you need assistance to take your bag,” she said. “He was a gentleman.”

She’s now hoping more people come forward to help police make an arrest.

Sgt. Bond says the department has received multiple tips from the anonymous Crime Line. Police are asking those people who called to get back in touch with detectives to provide more detailed information.

Mrs. Taylor says, “I know there’s someone who knows something.”</p>
